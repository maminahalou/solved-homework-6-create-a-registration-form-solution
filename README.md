You should use GridPane for this layout. Use Rectangle to simulate a text box. The “Register&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Cancel” button will not do anything when youclick on them.

You can either paste the screenshot into a Word document or simply paste it into the Comments ﬁeld when submitting your homework.
